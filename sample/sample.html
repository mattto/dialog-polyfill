    <h1>Dialog mock</h1>
    <p><b>This is a mock of DIALOG</b>. Some possible points of discussion:</p>
      <ul><li>Currently, the dialog has no border/UI by default. The page author draws the
        border. Should it?</li>
        <li>Open the login dialog. Then click the link to "open another
        modal dialog". This opens an anchored modal dialog. Notice you can
        scroll so that anchored modal dialog is off the screen. Is this ok?</li>
        <li>Related, you can open the login dialog, scroll toward the bottom,
        then open the anchored modal dialog. Again, it is off the screen. Is
        this ok?</li>
        <li>By default there is no visual cue that a modal dialog is open.
        Should there be?</li>
        <li>Should text selection/find in page be enabled when a modal dialog
        is open?</li>

      <a href="/wiki/Don_(honorific)" title="Don (honorific)">Dona</a> <b>Teresa Cristina</b> (14 March 1822&#160;– 28 December 1889), nicknamed "the Mother of the Brazilians",<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> was the <a href="/wiki/Queen_consort" title="Queen consort">Empress consort</a> of Emperor Dom&#160;<a href="/wiki/Pedro_II_of_Brazil" title="Pedro II of Brazil">Pedro&#160;II of Brazil</a>, who reigned from 1831 to 1889. Born a Princess of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Two_Sicilies" title="Kingdom of the Two Sicilies">Kingdom of the Two Sicilies</a> (also known as the Kingdom of Naples) in present-day southern <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, she was the daughter of King Don&#160;<a href="/wiki/Francis_I_of_the_Two_Sicilies" title="Francis I of the Two Sicilies">Francesco&#160;I</a> (Francis&#160;I) of the Italian branch of the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Bourbon" title="House of Bourbon">House of Bourbon</a> and his wife <a href="/wiki/Maria_Isabella_of_Spain" title="Maria Isabella of Spain" class="mw-redirect">Maria Isabel</a> (Maria Isabella). It was long believed by historians that the Princess was raised in an ultra-conservative, intolerant atmosphere which resulted in a timid and unassertive character in public and an ability to be contented with very little materially or emotionally. Recent studies revealed a more complex character, who despite having respected the social norms of the era, was able to assert a limited independence due to her strongly opinionated personality as well as her interest in learning, sciences and culture.</p>
<p>The Princess was married by proxy to Pedro&#160;II in 1843. Her spouse's expectations were disappointed upon meeting his bride, who lacked beauty, in person. Despite a cold beginning, the couple's relationship improved as time passed, due primarily to Teresa Cristina's patience, kindness, generosity and simplicity. These traits also helped her win the hearts of the Brazilian people, and her distance from political controversies shielded her from criticism. She also sponsored archaeological studies in Italy and Italian immigration to Brazil.</p>
<p>The marriage between Teresa Cristina and Pedro&#160;II never became passionately romantic, although a bond based upon family, mutual respect and fondness did develop. The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor's positions and never interposed with her own views in public. She remained silent on the topic of his suspected extra-marital relationships—including a liaison with her daughters' governess. In turn, she was treated with unfailing respect and her position at Court and home was always secure. Of the four children Teresa Cristina bore him, two boys died in infancy and a daughter of <a href="/wiki/Typhoid_fever" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a> at the early age of 24.</p>
<p>She, along with the remaining members of the Imperial Family, was sent into exile after a coup d'état staged by a clique of army officers in 1889. Being cast from her beloved adopted land had a devastating effect on Teresa Cristina's spirit and health. Grieving and ill, she died of respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest little more than a month after the monarchy's collapse. She was greatly loved by her subjects, both during her lifetime and afterwards. She was even respected by the Republicans who overthrew the Empire. Despite having had no direct impact on Brazil's political history, Teresa Cristina is well regarded by historians not only for her character and irreproachable behavior, but as well for her sponsorship of Brazilian culture.</p>
